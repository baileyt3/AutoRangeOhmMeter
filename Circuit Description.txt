How it Works!
OhmMeter.pfd is the circuit diagram
Items needed for this project.
1. Arduino Uno
2. 6 x BS170 FET's (Approx Â£2.50 for 5) These are used as they have a very low resistance when turned on ~2 Ohms.
3. 6 x 150K 1/4W Resistors.
4. 1 each of:-
  390 Ohm Resistor
  3.9K Ohm Resistor
  33K Ohm Resistor
  390K Ohm Resistor
  1M Ohm Resistor
  10M Ohm Resistor
5. LCD Display

The circuit starts by turning on TR1 and taking a reading on A0 (the Uno is using the default reference voltage 5V)
A reading is taken on A0, this value will be between 0 and 1023, this is then multiplied by the value BitVal which is
derived by dividing the 5V supply by 1024 which is the resolution of the analogue port = 0.0048828125 V/bit.
This will give us the voltage across R-Test.
Knowing this voltage we subtract it from the 5V supply, we now know the voltage across R1.
Because we know the value of R1 and now the voltage across it, we can calculate the current through the circuit of
R1->TR1->R-Test.
Using Ohms Law I = V/R
The current I is the same for the whole circuit.
We already know the voltage across R-Test, so again using Ohms Law.
R-Test = V-Test/I
We now know the value of R-Test or we know T-Test is > R1/2.
If the value returned is > R1/2, TR1 is turned off and TR2 is turned on.
The same process occurs, again we will know the value of R-Test or it will be > R2/2.
This process repeats using TR3, TR4, TR5 and TR6 until we have a valid reading.
If the result is still > R6/2 then the display will read "Out of Limits", you get this same display if there
is no test resistor fitted (Open Circuit).
On very low resistors, you need to take into account the ~2 Ohm resistance of the FET, other than this, the 2 Ohms has
little effect on any readings.
