# AutoRangeOhmMeter
Project to measure resistance using Arduino.
If you want to measure a wide range of resistors, a single series resistor would be unsuitable for all ranges.
To overcome this you need to change the reference resistor depending on the unknown resistor value.
This is achieved but using Field Effect Transistors to switch in and out various reference resistors, at any time only one transistor is turned on.

I used an Arduino Uno, but any Arduino type should work.
